## 🌿 Inspiration

Moving to a new country can feel like stepping into a maze without a map. Paperwork, cultural norms, and everyday systems can overwhelm even the most prepared newcomer. **NewLeaf** is the smart companion that turns confusion into confidence, helping immigrants navigate, adapt, and thrive from day one.

Many immigrants/newcomers struggle to navigate healthcare, education, and cultural systems while adapting to an entirely new environment. They face confusing paperwork, unfamiliar social norms, and the anxiety of starting over in a place where they have no guide. We were inspired by the real stories of newcomers who felt lost during their first months abroad, unsure where to go, what to do, or how to belong. We wanted to create something that could guide them, not just with information, but with **understanding, empathy, and empowerment**. 

**NewLeaf** is designed to be that first friend, a smart companion that helps newcomers feel confident, supported, and connected, turning uncertainty into opportunity and making a new country feel like home.

## 💡 What it does

**NewLeaf** is an all-in-one smart settlement assistant for immigrants/newcomers. It helps newcomers confidently adapt to life in **Canada, the U.S., and the U.K.** (more countries in progress) by combining:

- **AI-powered document conversion** – automatically converts transcripts, medical records, and other important documents to local standards.  
- **Personalized settlement checklists** – step-by-step guides for healthcare, banking, school enrolment, and essential services.  
- **Interactive chatbox** – a localized, real-time assistant that answers questions like “How do I apply for a driver’s license?” or “Where can I find local community events?”  
- **Community hub** – discover events, programs, and local activities to connect with people and culture.  
- **Cultural tips and mini-games** – bite-sized lessons to reduce culture shock, learn social norms, and navigate daily life with confidence.  

> **NewLeaf combines practical tools with emotional support**, helping immigrants thrive, not just survive. The chatbox ensures users always have instant guidance at their fingertips, making the app feel like a real-life companion.

##  How we built it

We built **NewLeaf** using a cross-platform mobile stack:

- **React Native & Expo** for mobile interface  
- **Node.js & Express** for backend services and chatbot logic
